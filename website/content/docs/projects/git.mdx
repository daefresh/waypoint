# Git Integration

A project can be directly associated with a Git repository to enable many features:

- Track exactly which Git commit is associated with a build, deploy, or release
- Poll and automatically trigger a `waypoint up` when changes are detected
- Manual [remote operations](/docs/projects/remote)

This is an optional integration. If you do not associate a project with a Git
repository, you can always execute local operations such as `waypoint up`
by checking out the source code and having a `waypoint.hcl` file.

## Configuring the Project

The Git repository associated with a project is configured with the
[`data_source` stanza in the `runner` stanza in the waypoint.hcl file](/docs/waypoint-hcl/runner).
These settings can also be specified via the CLI or web UI.

**It is recommended that you configure the Git data source using
the CLI or web UI.** This avoids tying a Waypoint configuration directly
to a single Git repository and also avoids secrets such as Git authentication
information to be present in the Waypoint configuration. Learn more about
[how to configure the Git data source using the CLI or web UI here](/docs/waypoint-hcl/runner#cli-or-ui-configuration).

Example:

```hcl
runner {
  enable = true

  data_source "git" {
    url  = "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples.git"
    path = "docker/node-js"
  }
}
```

## Polling

The project can be configured to poll the Git repository and
automatically trigger a `waypoint up` on any changes. To enable polling,
toggle polling to on in the web UI as shown below.

TODO SCREENSHOT

When polling is first enabled, it'll trigger an immediate poll. Subsequent
polling operations will happen according to the poll interval set by
the server (typically around 30 seconds).

### Configure via the CLI

You may also enable polling using the `-poll` and `-poll-interval` flags
on the [`waypoint project apply`](/commands/project-apply) command.
**This is an advanced approach. The UI is the recommended way to enable polling.**

## Ref Tracking

The project can be configured to clone a specific Git ref. By default,
any remote operations or polling will watch the latest commit of the
default branch. However, when configuring Git, you may specify any ref
for Waypoint to watch:

TODO SCREENSHOT

The value of this field can be a branch name, a tag name, or a fully
qualified Git ref such as `refs/pull/1014`. When a ref is specified,
Waypoint will watch only that ref for changes.
